* **September 3, 2025:** I gave a talk today about **"A Branch-and-Cut Approach for Decision-Dependent Robust Optimization Problems"** at the [OR2025 Conference in Bielefeld](https://or2025.de/).

* **August 12, 2025:** There is a new version of our preprint on **"Solving Decision-Dependent Robust Problems as Bilevel Optimization Problems"** (joint work with *Henri Lefebvre*, *Martin Schmidt* and *Johannes Thürauf*). You can find it [here](https://optimization-online.org/2025/02/solving-decision-dependent-robust-problems-as-bilevel-optimization-problems/). The accompanying open-source implementations are still available [here](https://github.com/simstevens/ddro-via-bilevel).
