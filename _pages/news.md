* **June 23, 2025:** Today, I gave a talk about **"Solving Decision-Dependent Robust Problems as Bilevel Optimization Problems"** at the [EURO2025 Conference in Leeds](https://euro2025leeds.uk/).

* **February 19, 2025:** The preprint for our new paper **"Solving Decision-Dependent Robust Problems as Bilevel Optimization Problems"** (joint work with *Henri Lefebvre*, *Martin Schmidt* and *Johannes Th√ºrauf*) can be found [here](https://optimization-online.org/2025/02/solving-decision-dependent-robust-problems-as-bilevel-optimization-problems/). The accompanying open-source implementations are available [here](https://github.com/simstevens/ddro-via-bilevel).
